    <h1>Project:Ada</h1>

     <h2>Intro.</h2>
     <p>Project:Ada started out as an idea to create to a device that could scan structures and find faults around them.</p>
     <p>The first few implementations were an iOS app where the user could point their camera and it would scan the structure.
     However due to the limitations of where the user could acutally point the camera in refereance to structure, created issues with no being able to take good images.
     Afterwards an idea to create a robot which would have easier access to reach places such as foundations of homes, would take place of an user pointing a camera</p>

     <p>Picture below showcase the hexapod robot called Ada.</p>

     <h2>Specs.</h2>
     <p>Ada is a hexapod robot which means it contains 6 legs and a body shaped as a spider. It was designed in Catia and CNC cut at Embry-Riddle
     It contains # servo motors, various sensors, rasipberry pi, motor controller and an arduino mega.
     </p>

     <h2>How does it works.</h2>
     <p>Ada works by using its onboard camera which is connected to the rasipberry pi and using a library called OpenCV, to scan wooden planks
    and determine if the wooden plank is fault by machine learning what a fault wooden plank should look like. </p>
